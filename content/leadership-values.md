- Don’t micromanage (micromanage means you want to control every detail of your team’s work, and you don’t trust them).
- Don’t try to be a hero (you feel like you need to do everything by yourself and you think that only you can solve the problems).
- Don’t keep information to yourself, share it with the team.
- Don’t fear failure, take calculated risks so you are not stagnant and not missing opportunities.
- Don’t only seek out information that confirms your existing beliefs while ignoring information that contradicts them.
- Don’t avoid conflicts, know your strengths and weaknesses, and communicate effectively with your team.
- Don’t do everything by yourself, delegate.
- Don’t blindly follow trends, research first if it is a good fit for your team.
- Always do knowledge sharing with the team.
- Create a safe place for feedback.
- Create an agile culture: embraces change, values collaboration, and encourages experimentation.
- Promote open communication, communication can prevent or fix almost any problem.
- Perfection is the enemy of progress. There is nothing perfect. We will always find a flaw. That’s why we don’t need perfection at the beginning of each time we do something.
